A few months ago I made the switch from Evernote to Apple Notes... and I haven't looked back since.

**The main reason being that Notes has OCR (Optical Character Recognition) out of the box, and it works great.**

Finding documents by typing in some text? Blazing fast, and accurate enough.

Other reasons are:

- Ability to unlock private notes with Touch ID
- It's 'free'
- It's convenient
- There's really nothing I miss from Evernote.

I also read that Evernote had to size down lately, and to me it made sense seeing the direction they took... they are overpriced, and do not cater users like myself... their focus are businesses... and they've lost a paying customer.

I have mixed feelings about leaving Evernote, partly because I'd like to support a company that needs my money more than Apple, but Apple just built a product that's simple and works. Like they do most of the time.

What do you use for note-taking? Let me know in the comments below.
