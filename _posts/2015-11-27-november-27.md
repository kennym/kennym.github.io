Today I started taking a course about ReactJS on Udemy. I am serious about it, because ReactJS presents a new way to write better and faster web applications.

I also purchased a course about React Native, which is also very intrigueing because it promises unified and native app development for Android and iOS with JavaScript only.

I canâ€™t wait to report on both of them.
