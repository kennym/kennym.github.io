So, I got into Wordpress development. Truth is I've been working with Wordpress for a long time already. What fascinates me about Wordpress isÂ **leverage.** You can quickly turn around new ideas in hours - not days or weeks.

My first Wordpress plugin: [Add Basic Auth to Contact Form 7 API calls](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-to-api-basic-auth/)

I hear people having had bad experiences with Wordpress when they tried it like years ago... if you're reading this: give it another shot. It has come a long way.

I've picked a client project which if I had needed to do it with Rails it would have taken me at least a week to get it to a stable state. With Wordpress I delivered that same day.

PHP really seems very inefficient for building anything a little of larger scope, but people are getting things done.
