## What?

18% annualized ROI with **[Horizen](https://www.horizen.io/).**

One earns rewards for running a cryptocurrency node. Each node requires 42 ZEN that are kept _in your own_ wallet. In simple terms a node helps secure and provide useful services to the network, which is why you are rewarded for that work.

## Numbers?

Minimum investment: 42 ZEN - 252 USD (1 ZEN ~ 6 USD)

Maximum investment: no limit

Monthly cost: ~2 USD per node

Monthly reward: flexible, 0.5936 ZEN or ~3.61 USD

Yearly reward: 7.2 ZEN or ~43 USD

ROI:

In ZEN: 7.2/42 ~ 18%

In USD: 43/252 ~ 17% (but beware that this depends on the price of ZEN, so can be less or more)

I currently have 10 nodes, with an initial investment of 2520 USD, earning me around 430 USD per year.

## How?

- Register for an account at [Binance](https://www.binance.com)
- Buy Horizen (ZEN)
- Contact Domenico @ administrators@cryptonode.support - he will tell you how to send your ZEN to your wallet (you own the keys) - Domenico is a friend for years, and I trust him.
- Profit.
